RubiksCubeSolver
============

This is my Fall 2012 Artificial Intelligence class project.

CalculateTables.java and SolveCube.java were written by me.  RubiksCube.java was written by my partner.

I designed the interfaces of all of the classes myself, as well as the algorithm used to store pre-calculated tables efficiently.

A technical writeup can be found in the report.pdf file.

Note: no one in the class was able to produce a program that could solve any of the cubes except for the first.
